# Grover’s Algorithm (Qiskit)

Still in progress...

This project implements **Grover’s quantum search algorithm** using **Qiskit**, focusing on a clear and structured implementation of the algorithm and its application to unstructured search problems. The project includes both simulation and execution on real quantum hardware, allowing for a direct comparison between ideal and noisy quantum results.

## Project structure

- `src/`  
  Contains the main Jupyter notebook with the full implementation, explanations, and simulations of Grover’s algorithm and utils used in the notebook.

- `src/utils`  
  Contains helper modules (`oracle.py`, `diffusion.py`, `noise.py`, `accuracy.py`, `plot.py`) used by the notebook.

- `figures/`  
  Contains the figures generated in the notebook (quantum circuits and visualizations) saved for inspection without re-running the code.


- `reults/`  
  Contains a json with the results of the simulations without any noise, with artificial noise and executed on real quantum hardware

## Project goals

- Introduce and explain **Grover’s algorithm** both conceptually and mathematically.
- Implement Grover’s algorithm in Qiskit with clear, runnable examples (small circuits such as $n=2$ and $n=4$).
- Provide reusable utilities in `src/utils` including: oracle construction, the diffusion operator, artificial noise-model generators, accuracy/metrics functions, and plotting helpers.
- Build and compose oracle + diffusion circuits for single and multiple marked states and compute the optimal number of iterations.
- Visualize circuits and amplitude amplification across iterations; save figures to `figures/` for offline inspection.
- Simulate the algorithm using Qiskit Aer under both ideal and controlled artificial noise models.
- Perform systematic noise sensitivity studies by sweeping 1-qubit, 2-qubit, and readout error rates and reporting accuracy metrics.
- Execute the algorithm on real quantum hardware (via `qiskit-ibm-runtime`), and compare hardware results with simulations.

## Project Requirements

### Python Libraries

The following libraries are required to run this project:

#### Quantum Computing
- **qiskit** - Core quantum computing framework for building and simulating quantum circuits
- **qiskit-aer** - High-performance quantum circuit simulators
- **qiskit-ibm-runtime** - IBM Quantum Platform runtime for executing on real quantum hardware

#### Scientific Computing & Visualization
- **numpy** - Numerical computing library for array operations and mathematical functions
- **matplotlib** - Data visualization library for plotting results and creating figures

#### Python Standard Library
- **math** - Standard mathematical functions
- **random** - Random number generation utilities

### Installation

To install all required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install individually:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer qiskit-ibm-runtime numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

- Open the main notebook at `src/grover.ipynb` and run the cells in order. The notebook is organized into sections: theory, circuit implementation, simulations with/without noise, noise sweeps, and hardware execution.
- Figures generated by the notebook are saved to the `figures/` directory for offline inspection and inclusion in reports.

## Reproducibility

- A global `SEED` is set in the notebook and used to seed `numpy`, Python's `random`, and Qiskit simulators to ensure reproducible runs. To reproduce results, keep `SEED` fixed or change it to another integer and re run the notebook from the top.

## Running on IBM Quantum

- To run experiments on real hardware you need an IBM Quantum account and an API token. Install `qiskit-ibm-runtime` and configure your credentials using either the Qiskit CLI or via `QiskitRuntimeService`:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
# store account locally (one-time)
QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<YOUR_API_TOKEN>")
# then instantiate the service in the notebook
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
```

- Be aware that queue times, hardware noise, and device calibration will affect results; compare hardware outputs to the notebook's simulated (ideal/noisy) runs.
